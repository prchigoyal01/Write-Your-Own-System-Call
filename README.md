# Write-Your-Own-System-Call
Coded as part of Operating Systems course (Monsoon Semester 2020).

Created a system call in C, called sh task info(), which takes argument as PID. It searches out the task struct() corresponding to the PID and prints out all the fields corresponding to it and also saves it in a file.
